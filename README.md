# Apollo 69
The game is a Space Shooter-like game, inspired by Atari’s classic Asteroids game, focused solely on online multiplayer.

The player will spawn as a spacecraft in space and can maneuver around. Moving asteroids will appear, which the player will have to avoid hitting. A booster can be used for a limited time to move faster.

The goal of the game is to gain points, which can be achieved in a couple of ways. Space gems are randomly generated and placed around the map. These gems can be collected by the spacecrafts, which will increase their score. Opposing spacecrafts controlled by other players are also spawned in the same environment, and players can attack each other by firing projectiles. Each spacecraft will initially spawn with a fixed amount of health, which will decrease when hit by a projectile or an asteroid and will be regenerated over time. When a spacecraft’s health reaches zero, the player is dead, and will respawn with zero points. The player who eliminated said spacecraft will receive half of the points obtained by other spacecraft before it died, and its health will be fully restored.

During gameplay, random power ups will be generated and placed around the map. When a power up is collected by a spacecraft, the properties of the spacecraft will be altered for a limited time, which will give it an advantage over enemy spacecrafts. Power ups include (but not limited to) improved projectiles, unlimited health and unlimited boost capabilities.
